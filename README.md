# üìö Quiz Platform Documentation

Welcome to the **Quiz Platform**, a modern web application designed to facilitate quiz creation, participation, and result tracking for students and instructors. Built with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this project integrates with a Node.js/MongoDB backend to deliver a seamless user experience. The frontend features a Dribbble-inspired UI with blue (`#2563EB`) buttons and a clean card-based layout, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics.

This document outlines the project's purpose, frontend pages, user dashboards, user types, permissions, and implementation details. Let's dive in! üöÄ

## üéØ Project Purpose

The Quiz Platform enables educational institutions to manage quizzes efficiently. Key objectives include:

- **For Students**: Participate in active quizzes, submit answers, and view results.
- **For Instructors**: Create quizzes, assign them to specific year groups, and track student performance.
- **For All Users**: Secure authentication, role-based access, and a responsive UI.

The platform supports multiple-choice quizzes with single or multiple correct answers, real-time validation, and detailed result reporting. It integrates with a backend API (`http://localhost:5000/api`) for quiz management, user authentication, and data persistence.

## üñ•Ô∏è Available Pages

The frontend, located in `src/app`, consists of the following pages, each serving a specific purpose:

| Page Path | Description | Key Features |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `/auth/login` | **Login Page** | User authentication with JWT token storage in `localStorage`. Redirects to respective dashboards based on user role (Student/Instructor). |
| `/dashboard/student` | **Student Dashboard** | Displays active, upcoming, and completed quizzes. Includes average score, "Start Quiz" buttons for active quizzes, and "View Results" for completed ones. |
| `/dashboard/instructor` | **Instructor Dashboard** | Allows quiz creation and management. Lists created quizzes with options to view/edit. (Assumed based on typical requirements; implementation pending.) |
| `/quiz/[id]` | **Attempt Quiz Page** | Enables students to answer quiz questions using checkboxes for multiple selections. Includes validation, submission confirmation, and time-based access checks. |
| `/quiz/[id]/results` | **Quiz Results Page** | Shows quiz results with a table of questions, selected answers, correct answers, and scores. Displays total score and navigates back to the dashboard. |

### Page Implementation Details
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Checkbox`, `AlertDialog`), `react-hook-form`, `axios`, `sonner` for toasts.
- **UI**: Consistent card-based layout with blue (`#2563EB`) buttons, responsive design, and error handling (e.g., loading states, not found messages).
- **API Integration**: Uses `src/lib/api.ts` for HTTP requests to backend endpoints (`/quizzes`, `/students/dashboard`, `/quizzes/:id/attempt`, `/quizzes/:id/results`).
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and `react-hook-form` for form handling.
- **Routing**: Dynamic routes (`[id]`) for quiz-specific pages, protected by token-based authentication.

## üë• User Types and Dashboards

The platform supports two primary user types: **Students** and **Instructors**, each with tailored dashboards.

### User Types

| User Type | Description | Dashboard Path | Key Actions |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Student** | Learners who participate in quizzes. | `/dashboard/student` | View active/upcoming/completed quizzes, start quizzes, submit answers, view results. |
| **Instructor** | Educators who create and manage quizzes. | `/dashboard/instructor` | Create quizzes, assign to year groups, view student results. (Assumed; partial implementation.) |

### Dashboard Implementation

#### Student Dashboard (`/dashboard/student`)
- **Purpose**: Central hub for students to manage quiz participation.
- **Features**:
  - **Active Quizzes**: Displays quizzes where `startTime <= now <= endTime`. Includes "Start Quiz" button linking to `/quiz/[id]`.
  - **Upcoming Quizzes**: Shows quizzes with `startTime > now`, with start/end times.
  - **Completed Quizzes**: Lists quizzes with `isScored: true`, showing scores and "View Results" linking to `/quiz/[id]/results`.
  - **Average Score**: Calculated from completed quiz scores.
- **API**: Integrates with `GET /api/students/dashboard` to fetch quiz data.
- **UI**: Card-based sections with blue buttons, responsive layout, and empty state messages (e.g., "No active quizzes").

#### Instructor Dashboard (`/dashboard/instructor`)
- **Purpose**: (Assumed) Allows instructors to create and manage quizzes.
- **Features** (based on typical requirements):
  - Quiz creation form with fields for title, description, year of study, timing, and questions.
  - List of created quizzes with edit/view options.
  - (Pending full implementation; assumed to use `POST /api/quizzes`).
- **API**: (Assumed) Integrates with `/quizzes` endpoints for quiz management.
- **UI**: (Assumed) Similar card-based layout with blue buttons.

### Implementation Notes
- **Authentication**: Both dashboards require a JWT token in `localStorage`. Missing tokens redirect to `/auth/login`.
- **Role-Based Access**: Backend middleware (assumed) checks `req.user.role` to restrict access (e.g., `Student` for `/students/dashboard`).
- **Dynamic Data**: Uses `axios` to fetch data from backend APIs, with error handling via `sonner` toasts.
- **Type Safety**: `src/lib/types.ts` defines `StudentDashboard`, `QuizDetails`, `QuizAttempt`, and `QuizResults` interfaces for type-safe data handling.

## üîí User Permissions

Permissions are enforced via backend middleware (assumed) and frontend routing logic. The table below summarizes permissions for each user type.

| Action | Student | Instructor | Notes |
|--------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Login** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Requires valid credentials; stores JWT token. |
| **Access Student Dashboard** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Restricted to `Student` role; redirects instructors. |
| **Access Instructor Dashboard** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Restricted to `Instructor` role; redirects students. |
| **View Active Quizzes** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Students see quizzes matching their `yearOfStudy` and current time. |
| **Start Quiz** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Students can access `/quiz/[id]` if quiz is active (`startTime <= now <= endTime`). |
| **Submit Quiz Answers** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Students submit via `POST /api/quizzes/:id/attempt`. |
| **View Quiz Results** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Students access `/quiz/[id]/results` for completed quizzes. |
| **Create Quiz** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Instructors use (assumed) `/dashboard/instructor` form. |
| **Edit/Delete Quiz** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Instructors manage quizzes via (assumed) API endpoints. |
| **View Student Results** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Instructors access (assumed) analytics or results endpoints. |

### Permission Implementation
- **Backend**: 
  - Middleware (assumed in `routes/students.js`, `routes/quizzes.js`) checks `req.user.role` and `req.user.id`.
  - Example: `GET /api/students/dashboard` restricts to `Student` role, verifies `Profile` exists.
  - `Quiz` model filters by `yearOfStudy` for students, ensuring relevant quiz access.
- **Frontend**:
  - Token check in `useEffect` redirects to `/auth/login` if `localStorage.getItem('token')` is missing.
  - API errors (e.g., 401, 403) trigger toasts and redirects (e.g., to `/auth/login` or `/dashboard/student`).
- **Security**:
  - JWT tokens are included in API requests via `axios` interceptor (`src/lib/api.ts`).
  - Time-based quiz access (`startTime`, `endTime`) prevents premature or late submissions.

## üöÄ Key Features and Highlights

- **Responsive UI**: Card-based layout with Tailwind CSS, blue `#2563EB` buttons, and Radix UI components for accessibility.
- **Multiple Answer Support**: Checkboxes (`@radix-ui/react-checkbox`) allow multiple selections, with validation for at least one answer per question.
- **Real-Time Validation**: `react-hook-form` ensures all questions are answered before submission, with clear error messages.
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling for API errors (404, 401, 403), missing tokens, and invalid quiz states (e.g., not started, ended).
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript with `src/lib/types.ts` ensures consistent data structures across frontend and backend.
- **Debugging**: Console logs (`Token`, `Quiz Details API Response`, `Form Data`, `Student Dashboard API Response`) aid troubleshooting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|---------|
| **Radio buttons not selectable** | Replaced with `Checkbox` components, updated `QuizAttempt` to support `selectedOptionIds: string[]`. |
| **Incorrect quiz attempt payload** | Modified `QuizAttempt` to include `questionId`, aligned with backend (`POST /api/quizzes/:id/attempt`). |
| **Quiz results type mismatch** | Updated `QuizResults` type to match API‚Äôs `attempt` and `quiz` structure, fixed `map` error in results page. |
| **Missing active quizzes in dashboard** | Added `activeQuizzes` query in `getStudentDashboard`, updated frontend to display in priority order. |
| **API errors (e.g., 404, 401)** | Enhanced error handling with specific messages and redirects in `src/lib/api.ts` and page components. |

## üì° Backend API Integration
